# Web Technologien - Portfolio

## Create a portfolio website

- Implement an “About Me” webpage with HTML and CSS.
- Define the data model of the website based on a list of requirements.
- Implement the model, the views and the controllers in Django.

## Rules

- Use at least 3 images
- Use between 3 to 5 colors
- Use semantic HTML
- Header, Main, Footer, Section, Article, etc...
- Have a navigation with at least 3 items (ie. minimum 3 pages)
- Implement a way to search through the content

## Criteria

- The web-application must run on your machine with no error.
- HTML must be valid
- Use the HTML validator service from W3C
- The pages must be properly styled with CSS
    - No inline styles
    - No ready-made styling libraries (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)
- Your application is testable
    - Using a story book with test cases (good enough)
    - With automated scripts using the testing framework from Django (even better)
- The code of your web application must be committed in Gitlab (version control is important).
    

## Next Steps

- Practice by creating simple pages.
- Implement the Figma mockup that will be provided later by our fictional client.

## Present your work

- 10-15 minutes with a demo.
- Explain the important parts of the website and how they works.
